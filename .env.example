# Environment Variables

This file documents the environment variables used in this application.

## Development

For local development, create a `.env` file in the root directory (this file is gitignored).

Currently, this application does not require any environment variables for basic functionality.

## Production (Vercel)

No environment variables are required for the current production setup.

### Future Considerations

If you add features that require environment variables (e.g., database connections, API keys), add them here:

```bash
# Example:
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
# API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Then configure them in Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable with appropriate values for production
